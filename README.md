## Concept of the project
The concept of the project is to develop a desktop application in python using the libraries **pandas and tkinter**.The application serves the purpose of concatenating two excel files either row wise or column wise.

## Libraries used
- [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/pandas.pdf) is used for concatenation.
- [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) is used for the gui.

## Algorithm
The algorithm of the project is simple and straight forward. The excel files are obtained from the user and are converted into **DataFrames** using pandas. The pandas dataframe objects has the method called concat which combines two data frames either row wise or column wise based on the index.

## .exe file
pyinstaller is used to convert the code to an executable file. since the code doesnt have external dependencies such as images or other code files , it is easily converted to an executable file.
